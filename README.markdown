SVNGUT
======

This is a simple python utility for digesting SVN repositories and sending a periodic
summary email to a configurable list of recipients.  

Configuration
=============
Copy the config-sample.py file to config.py and update the hash configuration details to 
indicate which repos to analyse and which email addresses to notify.  Should be fairly self
explanatory based on the sample content.
